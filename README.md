# PyBer_Analysis

Using Matplotlib, Python and Pandas to analyze and visualize Ride-sharing data with Jupyter NoteBooks.

## Project Goal

Improving access to ride-sharing service and determining the affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Report

The data displayed in the DataFrame shows us that rural cities have highest average fare per ride than suburban and urban by around 4 dollars and 10 dollars, respectively. When comparing average fare per driver, rural cities have better higher fares than suburban and urban cities by 40% and 230%. This is most likely due to the fact that there are significantly less rural rides and drives when compared to rides and drivers in urban and suburban cities. The multiple-line charts showcases the total fare per city type changes by times. The X axis shows date from 1/1/2019 to 4/28/2019, and total fare in Y axis. The urban line shows that there is increased traffic during the months of March and mid-April. The suburban line shows that there is increased traffic during mid-February. The rural line peaks in late February and erly April. Overall, urban cities have highest total fares all the time at just above $2500 at its peak, and rural cities are lowest all over time at just under $500 at its peak.
